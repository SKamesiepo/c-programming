#include <stdio.h>

int main(){

    printf("I like pizza!\n");
    printf("It's really good\n");
    return 0;
}







/*Notes For Hello World
- the top #include is an import statment for input output libraries we would need
- adding "\n" at the end make the next print statement go to a new line
- the return 0 at the end tests to see if there were any errors with the executed function.
if no problem you will see how it prints out "exited with code = 0" after it runs in terminal
else it will show error in the line and exit with code=1
